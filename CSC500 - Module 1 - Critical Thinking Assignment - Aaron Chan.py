# Creating Python Programs
# ------------------------------------------------

# ----------------
# Part 1 Requirements
# ----------------
# Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.
# Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, add them together to find the output. Also, subtract the two numbers to find the output.
#
# ----------------
# Part 2 Requirements:
# ----------------
# Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.
#  Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, multiply them together to find the output. Also, divide num1/num2 to find the output.
# 
# ----------------
# Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the code from parts 1 and 2, the results and GIT repository in a single document (Word is preferred).
# # Note: Refer to the Module 1 Overview for resources and help using GIT.

num1 = input("Enter first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter second number: ")

print("The sum of first and second number is", num1, "+", num2, "=", int(num1) + int(num2))

print("The result of first number minus the second number is", num1, "-", num2, "=", int(num1) - int(num2))
